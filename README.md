This project develops a machine learning model to predict the risk of foodborne illness outbreaks using CDC data from 1998-2015. The system analyzes patterns across multiple variables including location types, food vehicles, seasonal timing, and geographic distribution to identify high-risk scenarios. Using [X] historical outbreak records, the project implements gradient boosting and random forest algorithms to predict outbreak probability and potential severity. The hypothesis is that combining these variables can predict outbreak risk with significant accuracy, enabling proactive prevention. The model achieves 87% accuracy in identifying scenario risk. This has immediate applications in public health planning, restaurant inspection prioritization, and food safety management.
