This project is a machine learning model that would use real-time social media data to detect outbreaks of food illnesses.

It uses Twitter and natural language processing to analyze crowdsourced-data and predict if a "tweet" indicates an incidence of food borne illness, and if so, to extract critical information from this tweet such as geographical location and severity.
